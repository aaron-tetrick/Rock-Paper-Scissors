/* GOAL: Create a game of rock, paper, scissors with the user versus the computer.
--Begin with a function called computerPlay that will randomly return either ‘Rock’, ‘Paper’ or ‘Scissors’. We’ll use this function in the game to make the computer’s play.


--Write a NEW function called game(). 
--game() will contain playRound function.
--Play a 5 round game that keeps score and reports a winner and a loser

Write a new function called game()

The game() function should play a 5 round game that keeps score
Then reports a winner or loser at the end.
---
I need a variable with the player's score.
I need a variable with the computer's score.
I need to have a different result per round.
I need the scores of the player and the computer to change depending on the reult of the round.
At the end of 5 rounds the player with the most points should be declared the winner.
